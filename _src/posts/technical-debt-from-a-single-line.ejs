<h2>Accounting of Financial Debt</h2>

<p>
  Disclaimer - the pictures used in this post are not as strict and accurate as the U.S. and most other countries' accounting standars require, but still serve as illustration of basic concepts.

  Firstly, when you borrow, (e.g.) $1,000 from someone, you get $1,000 cash on the asset side, and $1,000 on the debt side in your accounting.

  <figure style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/images/posts/accounting2.png">
    <figcaption>Figure 1. You pay back $100 of the debt</figcaption>
  </figure>

  Afterwards, you pay back part of the debt, $100.

  </figure>

  However, you don't pay back only $100, because you need to pay the charge of the debt. So, if the charge is $50, you lose this $50.

  Of course, if you borrow $1,000, you don't just save it in your account. You borrowed the money to invest in something else, hopefully earning more than the charge of the debt.

  Talking about debt in accounting, and finance, there is one important thing to note -

</p>

<h2>Debt itself is not a bad thing, nor is it good</h2>

<p>
  Usually people are afraid of debt, and believe that:

  <ul>
    <li>No debt is ideal, keep it minimal</li>
    <li>You should pay back debt as early as possible</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>This is wrong mindset.</strong> why?

  As in this article, debt allows you increase your asset, which you can invest in something else.

  If you always need to "buy" your assets, you need to wait until your profit piles up to make the investment.
  That will significantly slow down your business.

<p>
  Of course, more debt means more charge to pay, but if you also have enough income to cover the charge, that is ok.
  So, don't blindly assume debt is bad, but the bad thing is <strong>broken balance </strong> between the charge from Debt, and your income.

<h2>Accounting of Software, from the debt metaphor</h2>

<p>
  You can look at <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardExplainsDebtMetaphor">"Ward (Cunningham) Explains Debt Metaphor"</a> to see why and how software is referred as debt.

  <figure style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/images/posts/accounting5.png">
    <figcaption>Figure 5. As long as you have software, there is always Technical Debt</figcaption>
  </figure>

  Like in Finance, you pile up Technical Debt to create or purchase software asset.

  <figure style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/images/posts/accounting6.png" style="max-width:100%; height:autox;">
    <figcaption>Figure 6. Technical Debt causes maintenance cost</figcaption>
  </figure>

  Technical debt causes cost in maintenance. as financial debt causes debt charge. One interesting thing about Technical Debt is you might end up only paying maintenance cost, without paying back the debt.

  <figure style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/images/posts/accounting7.png">
    <figcaption>Figure 7. Software generates benefit, that is why it can be accounted as an asset</figcaption>
  </figure>

  Also, software can be accounted as an asset, as that is expected to give you certain benefits. Benefits range from driving revenue (e.g. if your software is running your e-commerce site) or reducing cost by automating human tasks.

</p>

<h2>Technical Debt is not bad itself - single line of code is still Technical Debt</h2>
<p>
  When talking about this "Technical Debt" metaphor, people usually think Technical Debt = Bad Code/ Software, but drives you into a <strong>wrong mindset</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Any <strong>single line of code</strong> is Technical Debt, rather than just bad code.
</p>

<p>
  If you treat only bad code as Technical Debt, you tend to think it's something you need to pay back ASAP. That can hurt your business - as long as your Technical Debt is well balanced (i.e.) software's benefit covers its maintenance cost well, you don't need to pay back the Technical Debt.
</p>
  Like financial debt, Technical Debt is not a bad thing as long as it is <strong>well balanced</strong> against the benefits the software gives you.
</p>

<p>
  So, the important thing is again the <strong>balance</strong>. If your Technical Debt gets larger and larger, and at a certain point its maintenance cost exceeds its benefit, you start suffering.
